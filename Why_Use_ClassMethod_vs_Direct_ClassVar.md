# üß† Why Use `@classmethod` Instead of Accessing Class Variable Directly?

You wrote this working code:

```python
class Employee:
    employee_count = 0

    def __init__(self, name, age, position):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.position = position
        Employee.employee_count += 1

    def display_employee_info(self):
        print("Employee Information:")
        print("-----------------------")
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Age: {self.age}")
        print(f"Position: {self.position}")
        print(f"Total Employees: {Employee.employee_count}")

employee1 = Employee("Geetha", 35, "Senior Consultant")
employee1.display_employee_info()
employee2 = Employee("Ravi", 28, "Junior Consultant")
employee2.display_employee_info()
```

‚úÖ This works perfectly! So why use `@classmethod` like below?

```python
@classmethod
def get_employee_count(cls):
    return cls.employee_count
```

## üîç Reasons to Use `@classmethod`

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance-Friendly (Polymorphism)

```python
class Manager(Employee):
    pass

print(Manager.get_employee_count())  # Uses cls = Manager
```

- Using `cls.employee_count` makes it flexible for subclasses.
- `Employee.employee_count` is hardcoded and doesn't adapt to subclasses.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cleaner & Centralized Access

- Centralizes logic for accessing/modifying `employee_count`.
- Easier to extend in future (e.g., formatting, DB calls, filtering).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Semantic Clarity

| Task                           | Best Practice        |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Access object data             | Use instance method (`self`) |
| Access shared class-level data | Use class method (`cls`)     |

## üß™ Inheritance Demonstration

```python
class Employee:
    employee_count = 0

    def __init__(self):
        Employee.employee_count += 1

    @classmethod
    def get_employee_count(cls):
        return cls.employee_count

class Manager(Employee):
    employee_count = 0

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        Manager.employee_count += 1

e1 = Employee()
e2 = Employee()
m1 = Manager()

print(Employee.get_employee_count())  # 3 (includes manager)
print(Manager.get_employee_count())   # 1 (manager-specific)
```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

| Situation                              | Use `@classmethod`? | Reason                             |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Simple, one-class access               | Optional              | You can use `ClassName.var`         |
| Inheritance involved                   | ‚úÖ Recommended         | Uses `cls` to support dynamic class |
| Building reusable/statistical methods  | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Centralizes and abstracts logic     |
| Future-proofing with business logic    | ‚úÖ Yes                 | Easier to expand later              |
