# ðŸ“˜ Purpose of Having Coding Standards â€“ Detailed Tutorial

## ðŸš€ What Are Coding Standards?

Coding standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles, and conventions that developers agree to follow when writing code. These standards **ensure consistency, readability, maintainability**, and **reduce errors** across a team or organization.

---

## âœ… 1. Coding Standards Toâ€¦

**Purpose:**  
To promote code clarity, avoid ambiguity, and improve collaboration.

**Example:**
```python
# Poor
def cal(a,b): return a+b

# Better
def calculate_sum(first_number, second_number):
    return first_number + second_number
```

---

## âœ… 2. Choose Industry-Specific Coding Standards

**Purpose:**  
Different industries (banking, healthcare, e-commerce) may have specific **regulatory, security, and domain-driven** constraints that affect coding practices.

**Example (Healthcare):**
```python
# Must log user access in healthcare for auditing
def access_patient_record(user_id, patient_id):
    log_access(user_id, patient_id)
    return get_patient_data(patient_id)
```

---

## âœ… 3. Focus on Code Readability

**Purpose:**  
Readability ensures that code can be easily understood by others (or yourself in the future).

**Example:**
```python
# Bad
def fxn(x): return x*x+2*x+1

# Good
def calculate_polynomial(value):
    return value * value + 2 * value + 1
```

---

## âœ… 4. Standardize Headers for Different Modules

**Purpose:**  
Helps document the fileâ€™s purpose, author, change log, and usage.

**Example:**
```python
# Module: payment_processor.py
# Author: Gopi Suresh
# Description: Handles all payment transactions for the checkout system.
# Last Modified: 2025-05-29
```

---

## âœ… 5. Donâ€™t Use a Single Identifier for Multiple Purposes

**Purpose:**  
Avoid confusion and unintended bugs.

**Example:**
```python
# Bad
data = [1, 2, 3]
data = "Processed"

# Good
input_data = [1, 2, 3]
status_message = "Processed"
```

---

## âœ… 6. Turn Daily Backups into an Instinct

**Purpose:**  
Protect against data loss, accidental code deletion, or corruption.

**Tip:**
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Daily backup - May 29"
```

---

## âœ… 7. Leave Comments and Prioritize Documentation

**Purpose:**  
Explain **why** something is done, especially if it's not obvious.

**Example:**
```python
# Applying Newton's method to approximate square root
def newton_sqrt(n, guess=1.0):
    for _ in range(10):
        guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2
    return guess
```

---

## âœ… 8. Try to Formalize Exception Handling

**Purpose:**  
Prevent your application from crashing and provide meaningful error messages.

**Example:**
```python
class InvalidTransactionError(Exception):
    pass

def process_payment(amount):
    if amount <= 0:
        raise InvalidTransactionError("Amount must be greater than zero")
```

---

## âœ… 9. When Choosing Standards, Think Closed vs. Open

**Purpose:**  
Determine whether your coding standard is **closed** (strict and rigid) or **open** (flexible and evolving).

**Recommendation:**  
Define a **core set** of non-negotiable rules, and leave room for **team feedback and evolution**.
