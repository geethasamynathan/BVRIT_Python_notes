"""
This example demonstrates how Python represents complex numbers.

A complex number has two components:
- Real part (e.g., 567.78)
- Imaginary part (e.g., 0j where j is the imaginary unit)

So, 567.78 + 0j is a complex number with no imaginary component.
"""


# complex_number = complex(input("Enter Complex Number: "))
# This will convert your input into a complex number type.
# For example, if you input "567.78", Python will interpret it as (567.78+0j),
# which is a complex number with:
# - Real part: 567.78
# - Imaginary part: 0j (meaning zero imaginary value)

# print('This is a bell sound \a')
# print("Line1\fLine2")
