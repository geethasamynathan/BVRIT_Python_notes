## âœ… Assignment 1: ATM Machine Simulation

**Problem:** Simulate an ATM that allows checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, and exiting.

```python
balance = 5000
pin = "1234"

entered_pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")
if entered_pin == pin:
    while True:
        print("\n1. Check Balance\n2. Deposit\n3. Withdraw\n4. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == "1":
            print(f"Your balance is â‚¹{balance}")
        elif choice == "2":
            amount = int(input("Enter amount to deposit: "))
            balance += amount
            print("Deposited successfully.")
        elif choice == "3":
            amount = int(input("Enter amount to withdraw: "))
            if amount <= balance:
                balance -= amount
                print("Withdrawn successfully.")
            else:
                print("Insufficient funds.")
        elif choice == "4":
            print("Thank you for using the ATM.")
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid option.")
else:
    print("Incorrect PIN.")

    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f"Average: {avg:.2f}, Grade: {grade}")
```
